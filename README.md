# 🚀 Building Some Cool Side Projects in Bun

Welcome to my Bun-powered playground! 👋

This repository is a growing collection of side projects and experiments built with [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/) — a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I'm currently exploring what makes Bun so fast and productive. From its built-in bundler and test runner to native TypeScript and ESM support — there's a lot to love!

Stay tuned as I document my journey through:
- 🔍 Bun CLI
- 🧪 Bun's built-in test framework
- 📦 Dependency management with `bun install`
- ⚡ Performance comparisons with Node.js
- 🌐 Bun for building web APIs and apps

## 🛠️ What to Expect

As I learn more, I’ll be building and sharing some cool side projects here. Expect things like:

- 🗂️ Mini fullstack apps
- 📡 API experiments
- 🔧 Utility tools
- 🕹️ Fun playgrounds

Each project will live in its own folder with a detailed README and setup instructions.

## 💡 Why Bun?

> “Build, test, run, and install — all in one tool. That’s Bun.”

Bun promises speed, simplicity, and a modern developer experience — which makes it a perfect choice for creative side projects and rapid prototyping.

## 📌 How to Run

Once projects are added, running them will typically look like this:

```bash
bun install
bun run start
